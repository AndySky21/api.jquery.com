  <desc>Borrowing from CSS 1â€“3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of  tools for matching a set of elements in a document.

If you wish to use any of the meta-characters ( such as <code> !&quot;#$%&amp;&#39;()*+,./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^`{|}~</code> ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: <code>\\</code>. For example, if you have an element with <code>id="foo.bar"</code>, you can use the selector <code>$("#foo\\.bar")</code>. The W3C CSS specification contains the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier">complete set of rules regarding valid CSS selectors</a>. Also useful is the blog entry by Mathias Bynens on <a href="http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/css-escapes">CSS character escape sequences for identifiers</a>.</desc>
