  <desc>A selector representing selector originally passed to jQuery().</desc>

    <p>Should be used in conjunction with context to determine the exact query used.</p>
    <p>The <code>.live()</code> method for binding event handlers uses this property to determine how to perform its searches. Plug-ins which perform similar tasks may also find the property useful. This property contains a string representing the matched set of elements, but if DOM traversal methods have been called on the object, the string may not be a valid jQuery selector expression. For this reason, the value of <code>.selector</code> is generally most useful immediately following the original creation of the object. Consequently, the <code>.live()</code> method should only be used in this scenario. </p>
